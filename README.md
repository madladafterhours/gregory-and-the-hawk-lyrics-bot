# gregory-and-the-hawk-lyrics-bot
This is a very simple and efficient script I wrote in a few hours that accesses the Genius archive of every Gregory and the Hawk song and pulls it's lyrics.
Originally, this was meant to be a Twitter bot, and I still may make it into one but the source will remain in the public domain.
BS4 is required for the script to work.
